Requirements
============

For the scripts below to work properly, the following must be installed:

* OpenSSL-Query: Follow the instructions in its README.md

Optionally, OMC members can benefit from direct database access by installing
the QueryApp libraries as well.

Environment
===========

Some of the scripts use the information REST API on https://api.openssl.org.
If you have direct access to the databases and want to use that instead, set
the environment variable BUREAU to the directory where they are located.

=================
addrev is a simple pair of scripts to add or edit reviewers to commits.

To use add the scripts gitaddrev and addrev to your PATH and edit
gitaddrev to contain your email address.

Usage is

	addrev <arguments>

<arguments> can be one of:

--reviewer=<name> add reviewer <name> to commit range: can be used more than
once.

--commit=<id> only apply if commit matches <id>: can be used more than once

--rmreviewers remove all reviewers from commit range: useful if you screwed
up.

-<number> change the last <number> commits if not present assumes the last
commit only.

--trivial add the header "CLA: trivial" to the commits

Any lower case string is assumed to be a reviewer name.

Anything not matching the above is take to be a commit range.

If a reviewer already exists in the log message it is deleted before it is
added to the end of the log: this ensures a reviewer can only appear once
in a commit.

If the commiter is not the author of the commit then they are added
automatically as a reviewer.

Examples:

    addrev steve
    addrev -2 steve
    addrev -2 steve rich
    addrev -2 --reviewer=steve --reviewer=rich

=================
gitlabutil is a simple gitlab merge request query tool.

Before you can use it you need to create a file $HOME/.gitlabtoken containing
your gitlab token (see profile).

Usage is:

	gitlabutil [options]

By default it prints out a summary of all open merge requests. This
behaviour can be changed with various command line options.

--state indicates the state of the requests to query, it can be "all",
"merged", "opened" or "closed". By default only openened requests are searched.

--token indicates the private token to use (see Account Settings in your
profile). If not specified it will look for a token in $HOME/.gitlabtoken
It is a fatal error if a token is not supplied.

--desc indicates a regular expression which must match the request description

--user only print requests with the given user name.

[number] an optional number of the merge request (iid value as indicated in
the UI).

--text print the full description of the request.

--fetch create branch from matching request using same branch name as in the
request: there must only be a single match for this to work.

--checkout is like --fetch but also changes the current branch to the name on
the merge request.

Examples.

Get summary of merge request 1

	gitlabutil --state=all 1

Get full details of all requests made by user "foo":

	gitlabutil --state=all --user=foo --text

Checkout branch for query 145:

	gitlabutil --checkout 145

=================
ghmerge merges (reviewed and approved!) GitHub pull requests

It works on the current branch, which should be master or one of the stable
releases.

Usage:
        ghmerge ### reviewer...

The ### is the GitHub MR number.  The rest of the args are the names of
the reviewers (passed to addrev; see above).


=================
pick-to-branch cherry-picks commits to branches
