# HOW TO MAKE A RELEASE

This file documents how to make an OpenSSL release.  Please fix any errors
you find while doing, or just after, your next release!

Releases are done by one person, with a second person acting as the reviewer
and additional tester.

# Prerequisites

## Software

Apart from the basic operating system utilities, you must have the following
programs in you `$PATH`:

- openssl
- ssh
- gpg
- git

(note: this may not be a complete list)

## Repositories

You must have access to the following repositories:

-   `git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git` or
    `git@github.openssl.org:openssl/premium.git`

    `openssl/openssl` is the public source repository, while
    `openssl/premium` is the premium release repository.

-   `git@github.openssl.org:otc/tools.git`

    This contains certain common tools

-   `git@github.openssl.org:omc/data.git`

    This contains files to be updated as part of any release

## PGP / GnuPG key

You must have a PGP / GnuPG key, and its fingerprint should be present in
the file `doc/fingerprints.txt` in the source of the immediately prior
OpenSSL release.

## SSH access

To perform a release, you must have appropriate access to OpenSSL's
development host, dev.openssl.org.  To test this, try to log in with ssh:

    ssh dev.openssl.org

You must also check that you can perform tasks as the user 'openssl' on
dev.openssl.org.  When you have successfully logged in, test your access to
that user with sudo:

    sudo -u openssl id

## A method for reviewing

For reviewing to take place, the release person and the reviewer need a way
to share changes that are being applied.  Most commonly, that's done as PRs
(for normal releases) or security advisories (for undisclosed security
fixes) through Github.

Security advisories are created using the Github Security tab, and will
generate a private repository, to which you can add collaborators (the
reviewer, for instance), and use it to fix the issue via pull requests.
For more information, please read Github's [creating a security advisory],
including the "Next Steps" at the end of that page.

[creating a security advisory]:
<https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory>

The release person and the reviewer are allowed to use other means to share
the commits to be reviewed if they desire.

The release person and the reviewer must have a conversation to confirm or
figure out how the review shall be done.

# Pre-publishing tasks

Some of the actions in this section need to be repeated for each OpenSSL
version released.

## Prepare your repository checkouts

You will need to checkout at least three working trees:

-   one for extra tools

        git clone git@github.openssl.org:otc/tools.git tools

    The resulting directory will be referred to as `$TOOLS`

-   one for release data

        git clone git@github.openssl.org:omc/data.git data

-   At least one for openssl source

        git clone git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git

    or

        git clone git@github.openssl.org:openssl/premium.git

    If you're doing multiple releases in one go, there are many ways to deal
    with it.  One possibility, available since git 2.5, is to use `git
    worktree`:

        (cd openssl;
         git worktree add ../openssl-1.1.1 OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable)

## Freeze the source repository

Three business day before the release, freeze the appropriate source
repository.

This locks out everyone but the named user, who is doing the release, from
doing any pushes.  Someone other than the person doing the release should
run the command.

This must be done from a checkout of that source repository, so for public
releases:

    git push git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git HEAD:refs/frozen/NAME

and for premium releases:

    git push git@github.openssl.org:openssl/premium.git HEAD:refs/frozen/NAME

Where `NAME` is the github username of the user doing the release.

Note: it currently doesn't matter what source branch is used when pushing,
the whole repository is frozen either way.  The example above uses whatever
branch you happen to have checked out.

## Make sure that the openssl source is up to date

The person doing the release and the reviewer should both sanity-check the
source to be released at this point.  Checks to consider include building
and verifying that make test passes on multiple plaforms - Linux, Windows,
etc.

*NOTE: the files CHANGES and NEWS are called CHANGES.md and NEWS.md in
OpenSSL versions from version 3.0 and on*

For each source checkout, make sure that the CHANGES and NEWS files have
been updated and reviewed.

The NEWS file should contain a summary of any changes for the release;
for a security release, it's often simply a list of the CVEs addressed.
You should also update NEWS.md in the master branch to include details of
all releases.  Only update the bullet points - do not change the release
date, keep it as **under development**.

Add any security fixes to the tree and commit them.

Make sure that the copyrights are updated.  This script will update the
copyright markers and commit the changes (where $TOOLS stands for the
openssl-tools.git checkout directory):

    $TOOLS/release-tools/do-copyright-year

Obtain approval for these commits from the reviewer and add the Release and
Reviewed-By trailers as required.

*Do* send the auto-generated commits to the reviewer and await their
approval.

*Do not push* changes to the source repo at this stage.
(the source repo being one of `git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git`
or `git@github.openssl.org:openssl/premium.git`)

## Generate the tarball and announcement text

*The changes in this section should be made in your clone of the openssl
source repo*

The method to generate a release tarball and announcement text has changed
with OpenSSL 3.0, so while we continue to make pre-3.0 OpenSSL releases,
there are two methods to be aware of.

Both methods will leave a handful of files, most importantly the release
tarball.  When they are done, they display a set of instructions on how to
perform the publishing tasks, *please take note of them*.

After having run the release script, verify that its results are sensible.
Check the commits that were added, using for example `git log`.  Check the
signed announcement .asc file.  Check that the tarball length and hashes
match in the .md5, .sha1, .sha256, and review the announcment file.

*Do* send the auto-generated commits to the reviewer and await their
approval.

*Do not push* changes to the source repo at this stage.
(the source repo being one of `git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git`
or `git@github.openssl.org:openssl/premium.git`)

### OpenSSL 3.0 and on

The release generating script is in the OpenSSL source checkout, and is
generally called like this:

    dev/release.sh --reviewer=NAME

This script has a multitude of other options that are useful for specific
cases, and is also self-documented:

-   To get a quick usage reminder:

        dev/release.sh --help

-   To get a man-page:

        dev/release.sh --manual

### OpenSSL before 3.0

The release generating script is in the tools checkout, represented here
with $TOOLS, and is generally called like this:

    $TOOLS/release-tools/mkrelease.pl --reviewer=NAME

The manual for that script is found in `$TOOLS/release-tools/MKRELEASE.md`

## Update the release data locally

*The changes in this section should be made in your clone of the release
data repo*

-   Newsflash *[only for public releases]*

    Update the newsflash.txt file.  This normally is one or two lines.  Just
    copy and paste existing announcements making minor changes for the date
    and version number as necessary.  If there is an advisory then ensure
    you include a link to it.

-   Security advisory *[both public and premium releases]*

    Update the vulnerabilities.xml file if appropriate.

    If there is a Security Advisory then copy it into the secadv directory.

Make a pull request from your changes, against the release data repo (the
release data repo being `git@github.openssl.org:omc/data.git`).

*Do not merge the pull request at this point*, even if the reviewer already
approved it.

*Do* send the commits to the reviewer and await their approval.  It's
advisable to use this command to get a copy of those commits:

    git format-patch

# Publish the release

*BE CAREFUL*  This section makes everything visible and is therefore largely
irreversible.  If you are performing a dry run then DO NOT perform any steps
in this section.

Check that the release has been uploaded properly.  The release tarballs and
associated files should be in ~openssl/dist/new.  They should be owned by
the "upload" userid and world-readable.

Copy the tarballs to appropriate directories.  This can be done using the
do-release.pl script.  See $TOOLS/release-tools/DO-RELEASE.md for a
description of the options.  For example:

    sudo -u openssl perl ~openssl/do-release.pl --copy --move

This will copy the relevant files to the website and move them from
`~openssl/dist/new` to `~openssl/dist/old` so they will not seen by a
subsequent release.  Alternatively if you want to perform one release at a
time or copy/move the files manually, see below.

The do-release.pl script will display the commands you will need to issue to
send the announcement emails later.  Keep a note of those commands for
future reference.

For public releases, verify that the tarballs are available via FTP:

    ls /srv/ftp/source

For premium releases, verify that the tarballs are available via SFTP:

    ls /srv/premium

*For OpenSSL 3.0 and on*, push your local changes to the appropriate source
repo as instructed by `dev/release.sh`.  You may want to sanity check the
pushes by inserting the `-n` (dry-run) option.

*For OpenSSL before 3.0*, simply push your local changes to the appropriate
source repo, and please do remember to push the release tags as well. You
may want to sanity check the pushes by inserting the `-n` (dry-run)
option. You must specify the repository / remote and tag to be pushed:

    git push <repository> <tagname>

Upload the release files to the "Releases" section on github. Visit this URL:

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases

Click the "Draft a new release" button. Give the release a title, e.g.
"OpenSSL 3.1.0". Give it a description. Typically this will be the same text
that was used in the newsflash.txt file to announce the release. Upload the
four release files, e.g.

openssl-3.1.0.tar.gz
openssl-3.1.0.tar.gz.asc
openssl-3.1.0.tar.gz.sha1
openssl-3.1.0.tar.gz.sha256

If this is not the latest stable release, uncheck the "Set as the latest release"
checkbox. If this is an alpha or beta release check the "Set as a pre-release"
checkbox. Finally click "Publish release".

## Updating the release data

If there is a PR against the release repo to be merged, perform the merge
now.

When you do this for a public release, the website will get updated and a
script to flush the Akamai CDN cache will be run.

You can look at <https://automation.openssl.org/> to see the automation
builds in action.  The builder called `web` is of particular interest.

You can also look at the result at <https://www-origin.openssl.org>; the
CDN-hosted www.openssl.org should get updated withing minutes later.

# Post-publishing tasks

## Check the website

*NOTE: This is **only** for public releases*

Verify that the release notes, which are built from the CHANGES.md file
in the release, have been updated.  This is done automatically by OpenSSL
automation; if you see a problem, check if the web build job has been
performed yet, you may have to wait a few minutes before it kicks in.

Wait for a while for the Akamai flush to work (normally within a few minutes).
Have a look at the website and news announcement at:

-   <https://www.openssl.org/>
-   <https://www.openssl.org/news/>

Check the download page has updated properly:

-   <https://www.openssl.org/source/>

Check the notes look sensible at:

-   <https://www.openssl.org/news/newslog.html>

Also check the notes here:

-   <https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.0.2-notes.html>
-   <https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.0-notes.html>
-   <https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html>

## Send the announcement mail

Send out the announcements.  Generic release announcement messages will be
created automatically by the build script and the commands you need to use
to send them were displayed when you executed do-release.pl above. They
should be sent from the account of the person that owns the key used for
signing the release announcement. Ensure that mutt is configured correctly -
send a test email first if necessary.

If do-release.pl was used with `--move` be sure to move the announcement
text files away from the staging directory *after they have been sent*.
This is done as follows (with VERSION replaced with the version of OpenSSL
to announce):

    sudo -u openssl \
        mv ~openssl/dist/new/openssl-VERSION.txt.asc ~openssl/dist/old

## Send out the Security Advisory

*The secadv file mentioned in this section is the Security Advisory
that you copied into the release data repo, up in the section
[Update the release data locally](#update-the-release-data-locally)*
 
*This section is only applicable if this is a security release*

Start with signing the Security Advisory as yourself:

    gpg --clearsign secadv_FILENAME.txt

Then copy the result to the temporary directory on dev.openssl.org:

    scp secadv_FILENAME.txt.asc dev.openssl.org:/tmp

To finish, log in on dev.openssl.org and send the signed Security
Advisory by email as the user that signed the advisory.

For all releases, send them to the default set of public mailing lists:

    REPLYTO="openssl@openssl.org" mutt -s "OpenSSL Security Advisory" \
            openssl-project openssl-users openssl-announce \
            oss-security@lists.openwall.com \
            </tmp/secadv_FILENAME.txt.asc

For premium releases, send them to support-announce as well *and
separately*:

    REPLYTO="openssl@openssl.org" mutt -s "OpenSSL Security Advisory" \
            support-announce </tmp/secadv_FILENAME.txt.asc

When done, remove the email file:

    rm /tmp/secadv_FILENAME.txt.asc

Approve the openssl-announce email.  Go to
<https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/admindb/openssl-announce>
and approve the messages.

For premium releases, approve the support-announce email as well.  Go to
<https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/admindb/support-announce> and approve the
messages.

Check that the mailing list messages have arrived.

## Unfreeze the source repository.

This must be done from a checkout of the appropriate source repo:

    git push --delete git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git \
        refs/frozen/NAME

or:

    git push --delete git@github.openssl.org:openssl/premium.git \
        refs/frozen/NAME

## Security fixes

If this release includes security fixes with a CVE then you should inform
MITRE about them.  See the instructions at the top of cvepool.txt in omc.

Close the github advisory without pushing to github and remove the private
github fork if there was one.

## Keep in touch

Check mailing lists over the next few hours for reports of any success or
failure.  If necessary fix these and in the worst case make another
release.
