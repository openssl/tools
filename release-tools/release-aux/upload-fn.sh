# These functions all perform uploads, using sftp commands.
# They all expect two parameters:
#
# $1    The destination, properly formed for the backend.
#       In other words, it must be usable with SFTP for the sftp backend,
#       and it must be a proper existing directory for the file backend.
# $2    A flag, saying if the upload should (true) or shouldn't (false)
#       be performed.  In verbose mode (governed by the variable $VERBOSE)
#       this is useful to output what would happen if uploading was enabled.
#
# They also use the variable $VERBOSE as a command to perform verbose output.
# They may also use the variable $DEBUG as a command to perform debugging
# output.
# These variable must be set accordingly by the loading script.  Recommended
# values are ':' for non-verbose and 'echo' for verbose'
