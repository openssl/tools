Usage: stage-release.sh [ options ... ]

--alpha         Start or increase the "alpha" pre-release tag.
--next-beta     Switch to the "beta" pre-release tag after alpha release.
                It can only be given with --alpha.
--beta          Start or increase the "beta" pre-release tag.
--final         Get out of "alpha" or "beta" and make a final release.
                Implies --branch.

--branch        Create a release branch 'openssl-{major}.{minor}',
                where '{major}' and '{minor}' are the major and minor
                version numbers.

--clean-worktree
                Expect the current worktree to be clean, and uses it directly.
                This implies the current branch of the worktree will be updated.

--branch-fmt=<fmt>
                Format for branch names.
                Default is "%b" for the release branch.
--tag-fmt=<fmt> Format for tag names.
                Default is "%t" for the release tag.

--reviewer=<id> The reviewer of the commits.
--local-user=<keyid>
                For the purpose of signing tags and tar files, use this
                key (default: use the default e-mail addressâ€™ key).
--unsigned      Do not sign anything.

--staging-address=<address>
                The staging location to upload release files to (default:
                upload@dev.openssl.org)
--no-upload     Don't upload the staging release files.
--no-update     Don't perform 'make update' and 'make update-fips-checksums'.
--quiet         Really quiet, only the final output will still be output.
--verbose       Verbose output.
--debug         Include debug output.  Implies --no-upload.
--porcelain     Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts.

--force         Force execution

--help          This text
--manual        The manual

If none of --alpha, --beta, or --final are given, this script tries to
figure out the next step.

stage-release.sh - OpenSSL release staging script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<stage-release.sh>

B<--alpha> |
B<--next-beta> |
B<--beta> |
B<--final> |
B<--branch> |
B<--clean-worktree> |

B<--porcelain> |
B<--help> |
B<--manual>
]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<stage-release.sh> creates an OpenSSL release, given current worktree
conditions.  It will refuse to work unless the current branch is C<master>
or a release branch (see L</RELEASE BRANCHES AND TAGS> below for a
discussion on those).

B<stage-release.sh> tries to be smart and figure out the next release if no
hints are given through options, and will exit with an error in ambiguous
cases.

B<stage-release.sh> normally finishes off with instructions on what to do
next.  When B<--porcelain> is given, it finishes off with script friendly
data instead, see the description of that option.  When finishing commands
are given, they must be followed exactly.

B<stage-release.sh> normally leaves behind a clone of the local repository,
as a subdirectory in the current worktree, as well as an extra branch with
the results of running this script in the local repository.  This extra
branch is useful to create a pull request from, which will also be mentioned
at the end of the run of B<stage-release.sh>.  This local clone subdirectory
as well as this extra branch can safely be removed after all instructions
have been successfully followed.

When the option B<--clean-worktree> is given, B<stage-release.sh> has a
different behaviour.  In this case, it doesn't create that clone or any
extra branch, and it will update the current branch of the worktree
directly.  This is useful when it's desirable to push the changes directly
to a remote repository without having to go through a pull request and
approval process.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--alpha>, B<--beta>

Set the state of this branch to indicate that alpha or beta releases are
to be done.

B<--alpha> is only acceptable if the I<PATCH> version number is zero and
the current state is "in development" or that alpha releases are ongoing.

B<--beta> is only acceptable if the I<PATCH> version number is zero and
that alpha or beta releases are ongoing.

=item B<--next-beta>

Use together with B<--alpha> to switch to beta releases after the current
release is done.

=item B<--final>

Set the state of this branch to indicate that regular releases are to be
done.  This is only valid if alpha or beta releases are currently ongoing.

This implies B<--branch>.

=item B<--branch>

Create a branch specific for the I<SERIES> release series, if it doesn't
already exist, and switch to it when making the release files.  The exact
branch name will be C<< openssl-I<SERIES> >>.

=item B<--clean-worktree>

This indicates that the current worktree is clean and can be acted on
directly, instead of creating a clone of the local repository or creating
any extra branch.

=item B<--branch-fmt>=I<fmt>

=item B<--tag-fmt>=I<fmt>

Format for branch and tag names.  This can be used to tune the names of
branches and tags that are updated or added by this script.

I<fmt> can include printf-like formating directives:

=over 4

=item %b

is replaced with a branch name.  This branch name is usually the current
branch of the current repository, but may also be the default release
branch name that is generated when B<--branch> is given.

=item %t

is replaced with the generated release tag name.

=item %v

is replaced with the version number.  The exact version number varies
through the process of this script.

=back

This script uses the following defaults:

=over 4

=item * Without B<--clean-worktree>

For branches: C<OSSL--%b--%v>

For tags: C<%t>

=item * With B<--clean-worktree>

For branches: C<%b>

For tags: C<%t>

=back

=item B<--reviewer>=I<id>

Add I<id> to the set of reviewers for the commits performed by this script.
Multiple reviewers are allowed.

If no reviewer is given, you will have to run C<addrev> manually, which
means retagging a release commit manually as well.

=item B<--local-user>=I<keyid>

Use I<keyid> as the local user for C<git tag> and for signing with C<gpg>.

If not given, then the default e-mail address' key is used.

=item B<--unsigned>

Do not sign the tarball or announcement file.  This leaves it for other
scripts to sign the files later.

=item B<--staging-address>=I<address>

The staging location that the release files are to be uploaded to.
Supported values are:

=over 4

=item -

an existing local directory

=item -

something that can be interpreted as an SCP/SFTP address.  In this case,
SFTP will always be used.  Typical SCP remote file specs will be translated
into something that makes sense for SFTP.

=back

The default staging address is C<upload@dev.openssl.org>.

=item B<--no-upload>

Don't upload the release files to the staging location.

=item B<--no-update>

Don't run C<make update> and C<make update-fips-checksums>.

=item B<--quiet>

Really quiet, only bare necessity output, which is the final instructions,
or should the B<--porcelain> option be used, only that output.

messages appearing on standard error will still be shown, but should be
fairly minimal.

=item B<--verbose>

Verbose output.

=item B<--debug>

Display extra debug output.  Implies B<--no-upload>

=item B<--porcelain>

Give final output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts.  The output comes
in a form reminicent of shell variable assignments.  Currently supported are:

=over 4

=item B<clone_directory>=I<dir>

The directory for the clone that this script creates.  This is not given when
the option B<--clean-worktree> is used.

=item B<metadata>=I<file>

The metadata file.  See L</FILES> for a description of all generated files
as well as the contents of the metadata file.

=back

=item B<--force>

Force execution.  Precisely, the check that the current branch is C<master>
or a release branch is not done.

=item B<--help>

Display a quick help text and exit.

=item B<--manual>

Display this manual and exit.

=back

=head1 RELEASE BRANCHES AND TAGS

Prior to OpenSSL 3.0, the release branches were named
C<< OpenSSL_I<SERIES>-stable >>, and the release tags were named
C<< OpenSSL_I<VERSION> >> for regular releases, or
C<< OpenSSL_I<VERSION>-preI<n> >> for pre-releases.

From OpenSSL 3.0 ongoing, the release branches are named
C<< openssl-I<SERIES> >>, and the release tags are named
C<< openssl-I<VERSION> >> for regular releases, or
C<< openssl-I<VERSION>-alphaI<n> >> for alpha releases
and C<< openssl-I<VERSION>-betaI<n> >> for beta releases.

B<stage-release.sh> recognises both forms.

=head1 VERSION AND STATE

With OpenSSL 3.0, all the version and state information is in the file
F<VERSION.dat>, where the following variables are used and changed:

=over 4

=item B<MAJOR>, B<MINOR>, B<PATCH>

The three part of the version number.

=item B<PRE_RELEASE_TAG>

The indicator of the current state of the branch.  The value may be one pf:

=over 4

=item C<dev>

This branch is "in development".  This is typical for the C<master> branch
unless there are ongoing alpha or beta releases.

=item C<< alphaI<n> >> or C<< alphaI<n>-dev >>

This branch has alpha releases going on.  C<< alphaI<n>-dev >> is what
should normally be seen in the git workspace, indicating that
C<< alphaI<n> >> is in development.  C<< alphaI<n> >> is what should be
found in the alpha release tar file.

=item C<< alphaI<n> >> or C<< alphaI<n>-dev >>

This branch has beta releases going on.  The details are otherwise exactly
as for alpha.

=item I<no value>

This is normally not seen in the git workspace, but should always be what's
found in the tar file of a regular release.

=back

=item B<BUILD_METADATA>

Extra build metadata to be used by anyone for their own purposes.

=item B<RELEASE_DATE>

This is normally empty in the git workspace, but should always have the
release date in the tar file of any release.

=back

=head1 FILES

The following files are produced and normally uploaded to the staging
address:

=over 4

=item F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz>

The source tarball itself.

=item F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz.sha1>, F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz.sha256>

The SHA1 and SHA256 checksums for F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz>.

=item F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz.asc>

The detached PGP signature for F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz>.

=item F<openssl-{VERSION}.txt.asc>

The announcement text, clear signed with PGP.

=item F<openssl-{VERSION}.dat>

The metadata file for F<openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz>.  It contains shell
variable assignments with data that may be of interest for other scripts,
such as a script to promote this release to an actual release:

=over 4

=item B<update_branch>=I<branch>

The update branch.  This is always given.

=item B<staging_update_branch>=I<branch>

If a staging update branch was used (because B<--clean-worktree> wasn't
given or because B<--branch-fmt> was used), it's given here.

=item B<release_branch>=I<branch>

The release branch, if it differs from the update branch (i.e. B<--branch>
was given or implied).

=item B<staging_release_branch>=I<branch>

If a staging release branch was used (because B<--clean-worktree> wasn't
given or because B<--branch-fmt> was used), it's given here.

=item B<release_tag>=I<tag>

The release tag.  This is always given.

=item B<upload_files>='I<files>'

The space separated list of files that were or would have been uploaded
to the staging location (depending on the presence of B<--no-upload>).  This
list doesn't include the metadata file itself.

=item B<source_repo>='I<URL>'

The URL of the source repository that this release was generated from.
