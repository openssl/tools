Usage: release.sh [ options ... ]

--alpha         Start or increase the "alpha" pre-release tag.
--next-beta     Switch to the "beta" pre-release tag after alpha release.
                It can only be given with --alpha.
--beta          Start or increase the "beta" pre-release tag.
--final         Get out of "alpha" or "beta" and make a final release.
                Implies --branch.

--branch        Create a release branch 'openssl-{major}.{minor}',
                where '{major}' and '{minor}' are the major and minor
                version numbers.

--reviewer=<id> The reviewer of the commits.
--local-user=<keyid>
                For the purpose of signing tags and tar files, use this
                key (default: use the default e-mail addressâ€™ key).

--upload-address=<address>
                The location to upload release files to (default:
                upload@dev.openssl.org)
--no-upload     Don't upload the release files.
--no-update     Don't perform 'make update' and 'make update-fips-checksums'.
--quiet         Really quiet, only the final output will still be output.
--verbose       Verbose output.
--debug         Include debug output.  Implies --no-upload.
--porcelain     Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts.

--force         Force execution

--help          This text
--manual        The manual

If none of --alpha, --beta, or --final are given, this script tries to
figure out the next step.

You need to prepare the main repository with a new branch, '$release_branch'.
That is done directly in the server's bare repository like this:

Two additional release branches have been added to your repository.
Push them to github, make PRs from them and have them approved:

    $tmp_update_branch
    $tmp_release_branch

When merging them into the main repository, do it like this:

    git push git@github.openssl.org:openssl/openssl.git \\
        $tmp_release_branch:$release_branch

release.sh - OpenSSL release script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<--alpha> |
B<--next-beta> |
B<--beta> |
B<--final> |
B<--branch> |
B<--local-user>=I<keyid> |

]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<release.sh> creates an OpenSSL release, given current worktree conditions.
It will refuse to work unless the current branch is C<master> or a release
branch (see L</RELEASE BRANCHES AND TAGS> below for a discussion on those).

B<release.sh> tries to be smart and figure out the next release if no hints
are given through options, and will exit with an error in ambiguous cases.

B<release.sh> finishes off with instructions on what to do next.  When
finishing commands are given, they must be followed exactly.

B<release.sh> leaves behind a clone of the local workspace, as well as one
or two branches in the local repository.  These will be mentioned and can
safely be removed after all instructions have been successfully followed.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--alpha>, B<--beta>

Set the state of this branch to indicate that alpha or beta releases are
to be done.

B<--alpha> is only acceptable if the I<PATCH> version number is zero and
the current state is "in development" or that alpha releases are ongoing.

B<--beta> is only acceptable if the I<PATCH> version number is zero and
that alpha or beta releases are ongoing.

=item B<--next-beta>

Use together with B<--alpha> to switch to beta releases after the current
release is done.

=item B<--final>

Set the state of this branch to indicate that regular releases are to be
done.  This is only valid if alpha or beta releases are currently ongoing.

This implies B<--branch>.

=item B<--branch>

Create a branch specific for the I<SERIES> release series, if it doesn't
already exist, and switch to it.  The exact branch name will be
C<< openssl-I<SERIES> >>.

=item B<--upload-address>=I<address>

The location that the release files are to be uploaded to.  Supported values
are:

=over 4

=item -

an existing local directory

=item -

something that can be interpreted as an SCP/SFTP address.  In this case,
SFTP will always be used.  Typical SCP remote file specs will be translated
into something that makes sense for SFTP.

=back

The default upload address is C<upload@dev.openssl.org>.

=item B<--no-upload>

Don't upload the release files.

=item B<--no-update>

Don't run C<make update> and C<make update-fips-checksums>.

=item B<--quiet>

Really quiet, only bare necessity output, which is the final instructions,
or should the B<--porcelain> option be used, only that output.

messages appearing on standard error will still be shown, but should be
fairly minimal.

=item B<--verbose>

Verbose output.

=item B<--debug>

Display extra debug output.  Implies B<--no-upload>

=item B<--porcelain>

Give final output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts.  The output comes
in a form reminicent of shell variable assignments.  Currently supported are:

=over 4

=item B<clone_directory>=I<dir>

The directory for the clone that this script creates.

=item B<update_branch>=I<branch>

The temporary update branch

=item B<final_update_branch>=I<branch>

The final update branch that the temporary update branch should end up being
merged into.

=item B<release_branch>=I<branch>

The temporary release branch, only given if it differs from the update branch
(i.e. B<--branch> was given or implied).

=item B<final_release_branch>=I<branch>

The final release branch that the temporary release branch should end up being
merged into.  This is only given if it differs from the final update branch
(i.e. B<--branch> was given or implied).

=item B<release_tag>=I<tag>

The release tag.

=item B<upload_files>='I<files>'

The space separated list of files that were or would have been uploaded
(depending on the presence of B<--no-upload>.

=back

=item B<--local-user>=I<keyid>

Use I<keyid> as the local user for C<git tag> and for signing with C<gpg>.

If not given, then the default e-mail address' key is used.

=item B<--reviewer>=I<id>

Add I<id> to the set of reviewers for the commits performed by this script.
Multiple reviewers are allowed.

If no reviewer is given, you will have to run C<addrev> manually, which
means retagging a release commit manually as well.

=item B<--force>

Force execution.  Precisely, the check that the current branch is C<master>
or a release branch is not done.

=item B<--help>

Display a quick help text and exit.

=item B<--manual>

Display this manual and exit.

=back

=head1 RELEASE BRANCHES AND TAGS

Prior to OpenSSL 3.0, the release branches were named
C<< OpenSSL_I<SERIES>-stable >>, and the release tags were named
C<< OpenSSL_I<VERSION> >> for regular releases, or
C<< OpenSSL_I<VERSION>-preI<n> >> for pre-releases.

From OpenSSL 3.0 ongoing, the release branches are named
C<< openssl-I<SERIES> >>, and the release tags are named
C<< openssl-I<VERSION> >> for regular releases, or
C<< openssl-I<VERSION>-alphaI<n> >> for alpha releases
and C<< openssl-I<VERSION>-betaI<n> >> for beta releases.

B<release.sh> recognises both forms.

=head1 VERSION AND STATE

With OpenSSL 3.0, all the version and state information is in the file
F<VERSION.dat>, where the following variables are used and changed:

=over 4

=item B<MAJOR>, B<MINOR>, B<PATCH>

The three part of the version number.

=item B<PRE_RELEASE_TAG>

The indicator of the current state of the branch.  The value may be one pf:

=over 4

=item C<dev>

This branch is "in development".  This is typical for the C<master> branch
unless there are ongoing alpha or beta releases.

=item C<< alphaI<n> >> or C<< alphaI<n>-dev >>

This branch has alpha releases going on.  C<< alphaI<n>-dev >> is what
should normally be seen in the git workspace, indicating that
C<< alphaI<n> >> is in development.  C<< alphaI<n> >> is what should be
found in the alpha release tar file.

=item C<< alphaI<n> >> or C<< alphaI<n>-dev >>

This branch has beta releases going on.  The details are otherwise exactly
as for alpha.

=item I<no value>

This is normally not seen in the git workspace, but should always be what's
found in the tar file of a regular release.

=back

=item B<BUILD_METADATA>

Extra build metadata to be used by anyone for their own purposes.

=item B<RELEASE_DATE>

This is normally empty in the git workspace, but should always have the
release date in the tar file of any release.

=back
