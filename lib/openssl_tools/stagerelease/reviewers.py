"""Adding Reviewed-by: trailers to the commits this tool makes.

Two steps, deliberately separated:

`resolve` validates the reviewer names against the committer and CLA
databases.  It runs once, as a preflight check, before anything is written
or built -- a name that turns out not to belong to a committer should not
cost the caller a `make update` first.

`credit` then amends a commit's message with the tags `resolve` returned.
It does no database lookups, so the five commits a staging run makes cost one
round trip between them rather than five.  It does shell out to
`git interpret-trailers`, which places the trailer block.

The shell ran `addrev --release --nopr --reviewer=...` after each commit,
which needed addrev on PATH and re-queried the database every time.
