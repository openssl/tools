"""Version state and the scheme interface.

This replaces release-aux/release-version-fn.sh, which kept eighteen shell
globals and dispatched on $VERSION_FILE in five separate functions.  Here the
state is one immutable value object and each versioning scheme is a class.

`ReleaseState` holds only what is actually stored in (or directly implied by)
the version file.  Everything else -- series, version, full_version, the
pre-release tag -- is derived by the scheme, because the derivation differs
between OpenSSL 1.x and 3.0+.
