stage-release - OpenSSL release staging

SYNOPSIS
    stage-release [--alpha | --beta | --final] [--next-beta]
                  [--reviewer=ID ...] [--quiet | --verbose] [--debug]
                  [--porcelain]

DESCRIPTION
    Stages an OpenSSL release from the current worktree.  Run it from inside
    an OpenSSL source checkout, with the branch to release from checked out.
    It refuses to run unless that branch is master or a recognised release
    branch, and unless the worktree is clean.

    If none of --alpha, --beta or --final is given, the next release is
    worked out from the current state of the branch.

    Nothing is signed, pushed or uploaded.  The release tag is annotated but
    not signed: the signing key is held on an HSM the build host cannot
    reach, so signing the tag and the tarball happens separately, where that
    access exists.  Shipping the artifacts is the caller's job.

OPTIONS
    --alpha, --beta
        Move the branch into alpha or beta releases, or continue an ongoing
        series.  Both require PATCH to be zero.

    --next-beta
        Use with --alpha to switch to beta releases once this one is done.

    --final
        Leave the alpha or beta series and make a regular release.  Only
        valid when alpha or beta releases are ongoing.

    --reviewer=ID
        Add ID as a reviewer of the commits this makes.  May be repeated.
        Without it you have to run addrev by hand afterwards, which means
        re-tagging the release commit by hand as well.

    --quiet, --verbose, --debug
        Control how much progress output is produced.  By default each step
        is announced with a "== " heading; --verbose adds the output of every
        command and the files each step touched; --quiet prints only the
        final result.  --debug adds internal state on stderr.

    --porcelain
        Print the final result as shell variable assignments instead of
        instructions: orig_head and metadata.

RELEASE BRANCHES AND TAGS
    Before 3.0, release branches were named OpenSSL_<SERIES>-stable and tags
    OpenSSL_<VERSION>.  From 3.0 on, branches are openssl-<SERIES> and tags
    are openssl-<VERSION>, with -alpha<n> or -beta<n> for pre-releases.
    Both forms are recognised.

FILES
    Written to the parent directory of the worktree:

    openssl-<VERSION>.tar.gz
        The source tarball.

    openssl-<VERSION>.tar.gz.sha1, openssl-<VERSION>.tar.gz.sha256
        Its checksums, in the binary-mode format sha256sum -c reads.

    openssl-<VERSION>.dat
        Metadata for later pipeline steps, as shell variable assignments:
        update_branch, release_branch (only when one was created),
        release_tag, release_files and source_repo.
