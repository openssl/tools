"""The release state machine -- a port of release-aux/release-state-fn.sh.

`next_release_state` is a pure function: state in, state out, with the date
injected.  That is the whole point of separating it from the orchestration --
every transition below is reachable in a unit test without a git repository.

The phases a worktree can be in (the shell's "$PRE_LABEL$TYPE"):

    ''          released
    'dev'       in development, the normal state of a branch
    'alpha'     an alpha release was just made
    'alphadev'  alpha releases are ongoing, next one in development
    'beta'      a beta release was just made
    'betadev'   beta releases are ongoing, next one in development

Each staging run applies two transitions: one to move the tree *to* the
release being made, and one to move it on to the next development state.
