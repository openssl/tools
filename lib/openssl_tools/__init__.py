"""Shared Python for the OpenSSL maintainer tools.

Two subpackages, so they can import each other with ordinary relative
imports rather than reaching across directories at runtime:

    stagerelease   release staging, driven by release-tools/stage-release
    reviewtools    PR review helpers, driven by review-tools/addrev and
                   friends

The executables stay in release-tools/ and review-tools/ because external
workflows -- Jenkins jobs, the ansible role that symlinks them into
/usr/local/bin -- invoke them by absolute path.  Each one puts this
directory on sys.path and imports from here; there is no install step.

Standard library only.
