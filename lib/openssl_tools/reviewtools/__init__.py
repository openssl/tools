"""OpenSSL PR review helpers.

Standard library only, so these can be symlinked into /usr/local/bin on a
provisioned host without pulling in a package manager.

The public entry point for other tools is `add_reviewers`, which resolves
reviewer names against the committer database and returns a rewritten commit
message.  release-tools uses it directly, rather than shelling out to the
`addrev` script and needing it on PATH.
