"""Listing the reviewers a commit may be attributed to.

Backs `addrev --list`.  A person is listed when they have a 'rev' tag, a CLA
on file, and membership of the 'commit' group -- and each of their usable
identities is shown against that tag, so any of them can be typed as a
reviewer name.

This asks the API three questions per person, so it is inherently slow; the
client caches within a run, but there is no bulk endpoint.
