"""Turning reviewer names into validated Reviewed-by: tags.

The rules, carried over from gitaddrev:

- A reviewer may be named by anything the person database recognises: a
  short name, an email address, or a GitHub handle with a leading '@'.  The
  '@' is stripped before lookup.
- Every reviewer must resolve to a person with a 'rev' tag, that person must
  have a CLA on file, and they must be a committer.
- Whether the commit's own author counts towards the reviewer total depends
  on the repository policy: `min_authors == 0` means they do not.  A release
  run counts them regardless.
- Authors never get a Reviewed-by: trailer, even when they count.

Explicitly named reviewers and automatically collected identities are held
to different standards, and the difference matters.  Naming someone with
--reviewer asserts that they reviewed the change, so a non-committer there
is an error.  The author's address and git's user.email are picked up
without being asked for, so a non-committer there simply does not count --
erroring would make an outside contributor's patch unmergeable.

Note that one person can arrive by both routes: `--reviewer=<yourself>` on
a commit you authored is an explicit claim, and is checked as one.
