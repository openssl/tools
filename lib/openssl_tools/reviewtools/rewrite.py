"""Rewriting the messages of a range of commits.

This is what `git filter-branch --msg-filter` was doing, minus the
generality: replay the range with `git commit-tree`, then move the branch
with `git update-ref`.  Nothing is destroyed -- commit-tree only creates
objects, and the old tip stays in the reflog.

Tags whose target was rewritten are re-pointed, keeping their tagger, date
and message, which is what `--tag-name-filter cat` did.  Tags outside the
range are untouched, by construction: only targets present in the old-to-new
map are considered.
