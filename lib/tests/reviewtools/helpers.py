"""Shared fixtures.

Nothing here reaches api.openssl.org.  `FakePeople` stands in for the client
at the same interface, so the reviewer rules are tested against a known
database rather than whatever production happens to hold.

Note the shape of a 'rev' tag: it is the full `Name <email>` string that
ends up on a Reviewed-by: line, not a short handle.  That is why CLA lookups
have to pull the address back out of it.
